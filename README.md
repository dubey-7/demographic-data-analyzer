## 📊 Project Overview

The Demographic Data Analyzer is an interactive Python-based data analysis project that explores real-world census data to uncover meaningful demographic insights. Instead of just viewing raw data, this project processes and analyzes it to answer important analytical questions about income, education, race distribution, working hours, and country-wise earnings.

Using the Adult Census dataset, the program allows users to generate statistical summaries that reveal patterns such as:

By simulating a real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, this project demonstrates how raw demographic data can be transformed into actionable insights used in business intelligence, social research, and machine learning preparation.

🚀 It highlights practical skills in data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and statistical computation using Pandas.
